# invoiceninja

You can use this Dockerfile to build an image for Invoice Ninja that will run on a Raspberry Pi III (arm7v). 

I left the original code in the Dockerfile commented out so that you can have an idea of the changes required to get this up on a RPI. 

You can also use docker-compose to get everything up and running with a single command. 

Enjoy!
